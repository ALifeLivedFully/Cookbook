## How is this project being created/maintained?
I have opted for a simple pipeline that takes submissions from a google form since i am mainly working with non-technical people on this project. i am also coding simplistic code generators since i may be dealing with 100+ submissions which each need to have a page on the website.

### Post creation process:
1. Google Form (relying on the form to do the most basic data validation by imposing things like a minimum charecter limit)
2. the form submissions are then automatically entered into a google spreadsheet in specific cells.
3. spreadsheet then manipulates the data of the submission to be of a suitable format. (using simple formulas)
4. the manipulated data is then picked up by an advanced formula i wrote that essentially acts as a code generator and it constructs valid hugo style code for the submission.
5. Post each submissions unique code manually or automatically

### Why cant i just change XYZ? its just a simple google form/spreadsheet?

As you can see, a change to any one tool in the pipeline results in changing everything that follows.

## Todo (Simplified)
- [x] Create ReadMe
- [x] setup hugo site
- [x] install the Roxo theme
- [x] rewrite website code
- [x] fork the theme to change the section names and color scheme
- [x] write basic content to complete later
- [x] create example content
- [x] fix the crap i broke by forking the theme (could i have done this without formking the theme?)
- [x] fix annoying homepage title text
- [x] create pages for each cultures farming techniques
- [x] fix list and single item code for farm category
- [x] create google form
- [ ] embed google form into website? (this would be nice because then the project would continue to be updated with new recipes etc) only pay the original submissions though
- [ ] setup github action to auto create the submissions markdown file from the spreadsheet code generator


## Steps to produce a recipe
1. Type out the recipe and story
2. make the video telling the story and following the recipe
3. upload the video to IPFS/YouTube
4. embed the video within the recipe
5. upload the recipe to IPFS/Github
	1. Create a pull request for based.cooking?
6. produce shareable message (for emails, QR codes, etc)
7. Generate QR Code with sharable message (Likely using MailTo: format)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450F. Add 1 1/2 cup water and 1/4 tsp salt to a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. While water comes to a boil, cut tomato into 1/4" pieces. Zest and juice the lemon.
2. Add garlic and bulghur to the boiling water. Stir to combine, remove pot from heat, cover, and let stand until bulghur is tender and liquid is absorbed (15 mins).
3. While bulghur rehydrates, pat chicken dry and season with Za‚Äôatar spice blend, salt, and pepper. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 tsp oil, then the chicken. Sear until golden-brown. Transfer chicken to a sheet and bake on the middle rack in the oven until chicken is cooked through (10-12 mins)
4. Meanwhile, whisk together vinegar, lemon juice, lemon zest, 1 tsp oil, and 1/2 tsp salt in a small bowl. Set aside.
5. When bulghur is done, fluff with a fork. Add olives, spinach, tomatoes, and half the dressing to the pot. Season with salt and pepper, then stir to combine.
6. Thinly slice chicken. Divide bulghur salad between plates, then top with chicken. Sprinkle with feta and drizzle remaining dressing over top.
