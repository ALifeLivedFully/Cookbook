## How is this project being created/maintained?
I have opted for a simple pipeline that takes submissions from a google form since i am mainly working with non-technical people on this project. i am also coding simplistic code generators since i may be dealing with 100+ submissions which each need to have a page on the website.

Post creation process:
1. Google Form (relying on the form to do the most basic data validation by imposing things like a minimum charecter limit)
2. the form submissions are then automatically entered into a google spreadsheet in specific cells.
3. spreadsheet then manipulates the data of the submission to be of a suitable format. (using simple formulas)
4. the manipulated data is then picked up by an advanced formula i wrote that essentially acts as a code generator and it constructs valid hugo style code for the submission.
5. Post each submissions unique code manually/automatically 
	5a. Either programming something to automatically post the code to the website repo holding the code
	5b. OR manually create a new Hugo markdown code file for every submission manually (there could be 100+ submissions)

## Todo (Simplified)
- [x] Create ReadMe
- [x] setup hugo site
- [x] install the Roxo theme
- [x] rewrite code
- [x] write basic content to complete later
- [x] create example content
- [x] fix the crap i broke by forking the theme
- [x] fix annoying homepage title text!!!
- [x] create pages for each cultures farming techniques
- [x] fix list and single item code for farm category
- [x] create google form
- [ ] embed google form into website

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450F. Add 1 1/2 cup water and 1/4 tsp salt to a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. While water comes to a boil, cut tomato into 1/4" pieces. Zest and juice the lemon.
2. Add garlic and bulghur to the boiling water. Stir to combine, remove pot from heat, cover, and let stand until bulghur is tender and liquid is absorbed (15 mins).
3. While bulghur rehydrates, pat chicken dry and season with Za‚Äôatar spice blend, salt, and pepper. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 tsp oil, then the chicken. Sear until golden-brown. Transfer chicken to a sheet and bake on the middle rack in the oven until chicken is cooked through (10-12 mins)
4. Meanwhile, whisk together vinegar, lemon juice, lemon zest, 1 tsp oil, and 1/2 tsp salt in a small bowl. Set aside.
5. When bulghur is done, fluff with a fork. Add olives, spinach, tomatoes, and half the dressing to the pot. Season with salt and pepper, then stir to combine.
6. Thinly slice chicken. Divide bulghur salad between plates, then top with chicken. Sprinkle with feta and drizzle remaining dressing over top.
