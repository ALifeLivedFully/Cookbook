heading : "WeFarm and Spark-Y Teamup"
description : "WEE Farm was created to be a safe place where ALL are welcome to learn and interact. We believe the human/animal bond is powerful and transformative. We believe surrounding oneself with animals and nature can bring healing and growth for youth who have not had the opportunity to experience it.  Spark-Y serves its mission of youth empowerment through three branches: hands-on learning, urban agriculture lab, and youth pathways. These initiatives work together systemically, creating multiple touch points for youth engagement."
